Minecraft Platformer - (Feel free to fork it and make your own levels) - [DoubleAAGuy & ChrisCringle578]

All you have to do it download the exe and the textures folder to run it! (Don't forget the DLC.txt to play an extra 10 Levels)

How to Play - (Go to releases, download zip from latest release, extract and run MinecraftPlatformerRS.exe)

The RS is just a mistake and im too lazy to rename it

Also for some reason we can't put the EXE on the github page so you have to go to the releases to get the exe.
